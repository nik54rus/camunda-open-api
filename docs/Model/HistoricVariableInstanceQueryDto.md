**sorting** | [**\Camunda\Client\Model\HistoricVariableInstanceQueryDtoSorting[]**](HistoricVariableInstanceQueryDtoSorting.md) | An array of criteria to sort the result by. Each element of the array is                      an object that specifies one ordering. The position in the array                      identifies the rank of an ordering, i.e., whether it is primary, secondary,                      etc. Sorting has no effect for &#x60;count&#x60; endpoints | [optional]
