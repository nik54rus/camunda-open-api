**variables** | [**\Swagger\Client\Model\VariableQueryParameterDto[]**](VariableQueryParameterDto.md) | An array to only include executions that have variables with certain values.  The array consists of objects with the three properties &#x60;name&#x60;, &#x60;operator&#x60; and &#x60;value&#x60;. &#x60;name (String)&#x60; is the variable name, &#x60;operator (String)&#x60; is the comparison operator to be used and &#x60;value&#x60; the variable value. &#x60;value&#x60; may be &#x60;String&#x60;, &#x60;Number&#x60; or &#x60;Boolean&#x60;.  Valid operator values are: &#x60;eq&#x60; - equal to; &#x60;neq&#x60; - not equal to; &#x60;gt&#x60; - greater than; &#x60;gteq&#x60; - greater than or equal to; &#x60;lt&#x60; - lower than; &#x60;lteq&#x60; - lower than or equal to; &#x60;like&#x60;. | [optional] 
**process_variables** | [**\Swagger\Client\Model\VariableQueryParameterDto[]**](VariableQueryParameterDto.md) | An array to only include executions that belong to a process instance with variables with certain values.  The array consists of objects with the three properties &#x60;name&#x60;, &#x60;operator&#x60; and &#x60;value&#x60;. &#x60;name (String)&#x60; is the variable name, &#x60;operator (String)&#x60; is the comparison operator to be used and &#x60;value&#x60; the variable value. &#x60;value&#x60; may be &#x60;String&#x60;, &#x60;Number&#x60; or &#x60;Boolean&#x60;.  Valid operator values are: &#x60;eq&#x60; - equal to; &#x60;neq&#x60; - not equal to. | [optional] 
**variable_names_ignore_case** | **bool** | Match all variable names provided in &#x60;variables&#x60; and &#x60;processVariables&#x60; case- insensitively. If set to &#x60;true&#x60; **variableName** and **variablename** are treated as equal. | [optional] 
**variable_values_ignore_case** | **bool** | Match all variable values provided in &#x60;variables&#x60; and &#x60;processVariables&#x60; case- insensitively. If set to &#x60;true&#x60; **variableValue** and **variablevalue** are treated as equal. | [optional] 
**sorting** | [**\Swagger\Client\Model\ExecutionQueryDtoSorting[]**](ExecutionQueryDtoSorting.md) | An array of criteria to sort the result by. Each element of the array is                        an object that specifies one ordering. The position in the array                        identifies the rank of an ordering, i.e., whether it is primary, secondary,                        etc. Has no effect for the &#x60;/count&#x60; endpoint | [optional]
